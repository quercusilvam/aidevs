# AiDevs
Work with Python to learn interaction with AI tools.
Based on https://www.aidevs.pl/

## Running the code
To run each lesson just use `python3 -m <dir>.main`, f.e.: `python3 -m 1.main`.
Note no `.py` at the end of main!
If you try to run it inside from folder - the import of helper/config/common files will fail.
